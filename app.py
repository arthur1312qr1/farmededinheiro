# To get Gunicorn to recognize the hook, you need to use a config file.
# However, for simplicity on Render, we can rely on a different approach
# by checking for the Gunicorn worker process.
# We will use this in combination with the `create_trading_bot` function
# inside a specific route or event handler, but the simplest approach is to
# create a separate worker script.

# Since you are using Gunicorn, the best practice is to separate the web server
# from the trading bot logic. The bot should run as a background task.
# We'll use a `threading.Thread` to run the bot.
# The previous solution of using a `main.py` is more robust.
